# Wrap Executable in Self-Extracting Launcher

This proof-of-concept uses Linux shell commands in the makefile to
create a Go source file that contains an array corresponding to an
example payload.

The _selfexe_ file is built to run that payload.

## Payload

The example payload is the executable generated by compiling
payload.go, but it could be any executable.  The payload (named
"_payload_") is transformed into a string in a Go source file named
_payloadbin.go_.

## Wrapper

The wrapper, _selfexe_, is compiled along with the compressed payload
from _payloadbin.go_, and when it is run, it uncompresses the payload
into a temporary file.  Then it runs the temporary file with whatever
command-line arguments were passed to the wrapper.
